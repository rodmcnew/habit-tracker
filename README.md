# Occurrence Calendar v2

Demo running at:
https://occurrence-calendar.herokuapp.com/

Occurrence Calendar is a web app that allows you to keep a calendar of how often a given event occurs. All changes are saved immediately via REST calls.

Occurrence Calendar v2 is built with:
* TypeScript
* React
* Loopback (NodeJs REST API framework)
* NodeJS
* MySQL

# TODO in v2
- Get working with DB on heroku
- Undo eject from react-scripts now that found way to disable service worker in index.js
- Organize code? (hard to tell interfaces, react components, and services apart) 
- Turn "tslint:recommended" back on and fix all errors
