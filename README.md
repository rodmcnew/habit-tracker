Occurrence Calendar is a web app that allows you to keep a calendar of what days an event occures on. You can login through facebook or just bookmark your calendar's URL.

I wrote Occurrence Calendar to practice developing web applications with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js)
