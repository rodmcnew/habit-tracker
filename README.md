# Occurrence Calendar v2
Demo running at:
https://occurrence-calendar.herokuapp.com/

Occurrence Calendar is a web app that allows you to keep a calendar of how often a given event occurs. All changes are saved immediately via REST calls.

Occurrence Calendar v2 is built with:
* TypeScript
* React
* Loopback (NodeJs REST API framework)
* NodeJS
* MySql

### TODO in v2
- Undo eject from react-scripts now that found way to disable service worker in index.js
- Turn "tslint:recommended" back on and fix all errors
